Please feel free to contribute. I welcome any help that you may offer. Whether
it's fixing typo's, updating the documentation, or fixing bugs or adding new
features.

* Getting the source

  If you wish to work on git-auto-commit-mode you can get the sources by cloning
  the repository:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    git clone git://ryuslash.org/emacs/git-auto-commit-mode.org
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Style

  Use spaces, don't use tabs. If you can, keep lines shorter than 80 characters.
  Other than that, Emacs can handle indentation pretty well.

* Patches

  If you want to send any patches I'd be more than happy to merge them. Please
  feel free to use Github pull requests, or any other means preferred by you.
